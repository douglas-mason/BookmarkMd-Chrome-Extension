BookmarkMd-Chrome-Extension
===========================

A chrome extension for the Bookmark.md strategy.


bookmarks
=========

A repository to store my own bookmarks.
The plan is to manage this through an editor or via IFTTT triggers over markdown files stored on Dropbox.
Changes will be commited and pushed to this repository for online viewing as well as obvious change control benefits.

Bookmarks will be categorized by file: 
development.md, finance.md, homeowner.md

The links will be created in the markdown syntax and can be tagged within the description

```markdown
[Google #SearchEngine](http://www.google.com)
```
The idea is that text editor features can be used to use and manage your bookmark list.  For instance, text search can be handle via the Find (Ctrl-F) feature or through plugins such as Vim's [ag.vim](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim) plugin for Silver Searcher (AG).

With that said, command line tools could also be used such as [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), grep, or ack.
Other ideas could be [Exuberant Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) or integration with a Todo.txt workflow using [Todo.txt-CLI](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli)
